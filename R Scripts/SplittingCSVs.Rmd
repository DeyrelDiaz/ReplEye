### Useful funcitons

```{r}
# Define the function to clean up the environment
clean_up_environment <- function(keep_vars_list, keep_funcs = TRUE) {
  # List all objects in the global environment
  all_vars <- ls(envir = .GlobalEnv)
  
  # Identify the variables to remove, excluding the ones to keep
  vars_to_remove <- setdiff(all_vars, keep_vars_list)

    # Filter out functions from the list of variables to remove
    vars_to_remove <- vars_to_remove[sapply(vars_to_remove, function(x) !is.function(get(x, envir = .GlobalEnv)))]
  }
  
  # Remove the identified variables and functions from the global environment
  rm(list = vars_to_remove, envir = .GlobalEnv)
  
  # Optionally, you can run gc() to free up memory
  gc()
}
```

### Renumbering Folders and PIDs

Look at P_019 to fix where Mid is supposed to be MiddleEast

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Filter folders with names with the format "P_000"
p_folderNames <- grep("^P_\\d{3}$", basename(folders), value = TRUE)

# List of the p folder paths
p_folderPaths <- c()

for (p_folder in p_folderNames) {
  p_folderPaths <- c(p_folderPaths, file.path(base_path, p_folder))
}

folderNum <- 1
totalFolders <- length(p_folderPaths)
# Reorganize PID number and Folder number
for (p_folderPath in p_folderPaths) {
  
  # Create the new folder name (e.g., "P_001", "P_002", etc.)
  new_folder_name <- sprintf("P_%03d", folderNum)
  new_folder_path <- file.path(dirname(p_folderPath), new_folder_name)
  
  # Rename the folder if necessary
  if (basename(p_folderPath) != new_folder_name) {
    file.rename(p_folderPath, new_folder_path)
  }
  
  # Update the path to the renamed folder
  p_folderPath <- new_folder_path
  
  # Read the MatrixData.csv file for the current participant
  dfMatrix <- read.csv(file = sprintf("%s/MatrixData.CSV", p_folderPath))
  dfGaze <- read.csv(file = sprintf("%s/RawGazeData.CSV", p_folderPath))
  dfSurvey <- read.csv(file = sprintf("%s/SurveyData.CSV", p_folderPath))
  
  # Update the the PID column
  dfMatrix[,1] <- folderNum
  dfGaze[,1] <- folderNum
  dfSurvey[,1] <- folderNum
  
  # Overwrite the original CSV files
  write.csv(dfMatrix, file = sprintf("%s/MatrixData.CSV", p_folderPath), row.names = FALSE)
  write.csv(dfGaze, file = sprintf("%s/RawGazeData.CSV", p_folderPath), row.names = FALSE)
  write.csv(dfSurvey, file = sprintf("%s/SurveyData.CSV", p_folderPath), row.names = FALSE)
  
  # Increment the folder number for the next participant
  folderNum <- folderNum + 1
  
  # Check if folderNum has reached the count of total folders
  if (folderNum > totalFolders) {
    break
  }
}

# Delete any remaining folders
remaining_folders <- p_folderPaths[folderNum:length(p_folderPaths)]
for (folder in remaining_folders) {

### creating new duplicate split folders

  }

# Create "S_000" folders
for (p_folder in p_folderNames) {
