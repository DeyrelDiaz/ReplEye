# ReplEye: An Open Source Pipeline for Gathering, Analyzing, and Replaying Eye-Tracking Data with MRTK

## About the Pipeline

**ReplEye** is an open-source toolkit for developers and researchers working with the Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK). It enables the recording, analyzing, and replaying of eye-tracking data from Mixed Reality devices. This toolkit is ideal for prototyping, usability testing, and behavioral research. Sample use cases are provided and ready to run on the Microsoft HoloLens 2 as a standalone Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application.

This toolkit is released under the **MIT License**.

This toolkit was presented as a paper highlighting the toolkit's inspiration, design choices, and structure. If you use any part, or all, of this toolkit for research, we ask that you cite the corresponding paper.

## Tools

### Capsule Collider Dimensions and Degree of Visual Angle (DVA)

This tool calculates the **real-world dimensions** and **DVA** of each `CapsuleCollider` relative to the Main Camera. This is useful for eye-tracking and behavioral analysis where spatial awareness and visual perception matter.

- Not included in builds (Editor-only)
- Script location: `Assets/Editor/Tools/CapsuleColliderDimensionsAndDVA/`
- Output file: `Assets/Data/ColliderMeasurements/CapsuleColliderDimensionsAndDVA.csv`

### ðŸ”§ How to Use

1. In Unity, select one or more GameObjects with CapsuleColliders.
2. Go to `Tools > Calculate Capsule Collider Dimensions and DVA`.
